# Coach Guide Fix

## Overview

This document describes the fix for the Telegram parsing error in the Coach Guide functionality that was preventing users from accessing the coach guide content.

## Problem Description

### Error Details
**Error Message**: `Telegram server says - Bad Request: can't parse entities: Can't find end of the entity starting at byte offset 546`

**Location**: `handle_coach_guide()` function in `src/easy_track/bot.py`

**Trigger**: When users clicked the "üéì –î–æ–≤—ñ–¥–Ω–∏–∫ —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞" (Coach Guide) button

### Root Cause Analysis
The error was caused by two main issues:

1. **@ Symbol Interpretation**: The guide content contained `@username` and `@john_doe` examples that Telegram interpreted as user mentions when `parse_mode="Markdown"` was enabled
2. **Markdown Parsing Conflicts**: Telegram's Markdown parser couldn't properly handle the @ symbols within the formatted text

### Impact
- Coach guide button was completely non-functional
- Users received error messages when trying to access guidance
- Poor user experience for coaches seeking help

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Parse Mode
**File**: `src/easy_track/bot.py`
**Function**: `handle_coach_guide()`
**Change**: Removed `parse_mode="Markdown"` parameter

```python
# Before
await callback.message.edit_text(
    guide_text, reply_markup=keyboard.as_markup(), parse_mode="Markdown"
)

# After
await callback.message.edit_text(
    guide_text, reply_markup=keyboard.as_markup()
)
```

### 2. Updated Translation Content
**Files**:
- `src/easy_track/i18n/translations/uk.json`
- `src/easy_track/i18n/translations/en.json`

**Changes Made**:
- Removed `@` symbols from username examples
- Changed `@username` to `username`
- Changed `@john_doe` to `john_doe`
- Preserved all other formatting and information

**Ukrainian Content**:
```json
// Before
"‚Ä¢ –í–∏–∫–æ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤—É–π—Ç–µ —ó—Ö @username (–Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∏–∫–ª–∞–¥ @john_doe)"

// After
"‚Ä¢ –í–∏–∫–æ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤—É–π—Ç–µ —ó—Ö username (–Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∏–∫–ª–∞–¥ john_doe)"
```

**English Content**:
```json
// Before
"‚Ä¢ Use their @username (like @john_doe)"

// After
"‚Ä¢ Use their username (like john_doe)"
```
