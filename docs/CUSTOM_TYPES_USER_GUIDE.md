# Custom Measurement Types - User Guide

This guide explains how to create and use custom measurement types in the EasySize bot.

## 🎯 What Are Custom Measurement Types?

Custom measurement types allow you to track measurements that aren't included in the default system types. For example:
- **Blood Pressure** (mmHg)
- **Body Temperature** (°C)
- **Mood Rating** (1-10)
- **Sleep Hours** (hours)
- **Water Intake** (liters)

### 🌐 Multilingual Support
The custom measurement type feature is fully translated and supports:
- **English** 🇺🇸 - Complete interface in English
- **Ukrainian** 🇺🇦 - Повний інтерфейс українською мовою
- All prompts, error messages, and success notifications appear in your selected language
- Language can be changed anytime via **🌐 Language** in the main menu

### Step 2: Enter Type Details

### "Can I edit or delete custom types?"

### "Can other users see my custom types?"
No, custom types are private to your account. Other users cannot see or use your custom measurement types.

## 💡 Tips for Better Custom Types

### Naming Best Practices
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Avoid abbreviations when possible
- Be consistent with naming patterns

### Unit Selection
- Use standard units when possible (kg, cm, °C, etc.)
- Be consistent across related measurements
- Consider your audience (metric vs imperial)

### Good Examples
- **Heart Rate** (bpm) - "Resting heart rate measurement"
- **Sleep Quality** (1-10) - "Subjective sleep quality rating"
- **Blood Glucose** (mg/dL) - "Blood sugar level measurement"
