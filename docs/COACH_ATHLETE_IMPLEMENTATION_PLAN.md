## üèóÔ∏è Detailed Implementation Steps

### **Step 1: Database Model Extensions**

#### 1.1 Create CoachAthleteRelationship Model
**File**: `src/easy_track/models.py`

```python
class CoachAthleteRelationship(Base):
    __tablename__ = "coach_athlete_relationships"

    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    coach_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"), nullable=False)
    athlete_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"), nullable=False)
    is_active: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(Boolean, default=True, nullable=False)
    added_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now())

    # Prevent duplicate relationships
    __table_args__ = (
        UniqueConstraint("coach_id", "athlete_id", name="uq_coach_athlete"),
        # Prevent self-relationships
        CheckConstraint("coach_id != athlete_id", name="check_no_self_coaching"),
    )

    # Relationships
    coach: Mapped["User"] = relationship("User", foreign_keys=[coach_id], back_populates="coached_athletes")
    athlete: Mapped["User"] = relationship("User", foreign_keys=[athlete_id], back_populates="coaches")
```

#### 1.2 Add UserRole Enum and Update User Model
**File**: `src/easy_track/models.py`

```python
from enum import Enum

class UserRole(str, Enum):
    ATHLETE = "athlete"
    COACH = "coach"
    BOTH = "both"  # Can be both coach and athlete

# Add to User model:
user_role: Mapped[UserRole] = mapped_column(String(20), default=UserRole.ATHLETE, nullable=False)

# Add relationships to User model:
coached_athletes: Mapped[List["CoachAthleteRelationship"]] = relationship(
    "CoachAthleteRelationship", foreign_keys="CoachAthleteRelationship.coach_id", back_populates="coach"
)
coaches: Mapped[List["CoachAthleteRelationship"]] = relationship(
    "CoachAthleteRelationship", foreign_keys="CoachAthleteRelationship.athlete_id", back_populates="athlete"
)
```

#### 1.3 Create Database Migration
**Command**: `make db-migrate`
**Description**: "Add coach-athlete relationship functionality"

### **Step 2: Repository Layer Extensions**

#### 2.1 Create CoachAthleteRepository
**File**: `src/easy_track/repositories.py`

```python
class CoachAthleteRepository:
    @staticmethod
    async def add_athlete_to_coach(session: AsyncSession, coach_id: int, athlete_id: int) -> CoachAthleteRelationship:
        """Add athlete to coach's supervision."""

    @staticmethod
    async def remove_athlete_from_coach(session: AsyncSession, coach_id: int, athlete_id: int) -> bool:
        """Remove athlete from coach's supervision."""

    @staticmethod
    async def get_coach_athletes(session: AsyncSession, coach_id: int) -> List[User]:
        """Get all athletes supervised by coach."""

    @staticmethod
    async def get_athlete_coaches(session: AsyncSession, athlete_id: int) -> List[User]:
        """Get all coaches supervising athlete."""

    @staticmethod
    async def is_coach_of_athlete(session: AsyncSession, coach_id: int, athlete_id: int) -> bool:
        """Check if coach supervises athlete."""

    @staticmethod
    async def get_relationship(session: AsyncSession, coach_id: int, athlete_id: int) -> Optional[CoachAthleteRelationship]:
        """Get specific coach-athlete relationship."""
```

#### 2.2 Extend UserRepository
**File**: `src/easy_track/repositories.py`

```python
# Add to UserRepository:
@staticmethod
async def update_user_role(session: AsyncSession, user_id: int, role: UserRole) -> User:
    """Update user role."""

@staticmethod
async def get_users_by_role(session: AsyncSession, role: UserRole) -> List[User]:
    """Get users by role."""

@staticmethod
async def find_user_by_username(session: AsyncSession, username: str) -> Optional[User]:
    """Find user by username."""
```

#### 2.3 Extend MeasurementRepository
**File**: `src/easy_track/repositories.py`

```python
# Add to MeasurementRepository:
@staticmethod
async def get_athlete_measurements_for_coach(session: AsyncSession, coach_id: int, athlete_id: int, **kwargs) -> List[Measurement]:
    """Get athlete measurements if coach has permission."""

@staticmethod
async def get_recent_measurements_for_coach_athletes(session: AsyncSession, coach_id: int, days: int = 7) -> List[Measurement]:
    """Get recent measurements from all coach's athletes."""
```

### **Step 3: Bot Command Implementation**

#### 3.1 Add Coach Commands
**File**: `src/easy_track/bot.py`

Commands to implement:
- `/add_athlete <username>` - Add athlete by username
- `/list_athletes` - List all supervised athletes
- `/remove_athlete <username>` - Remove athlete from supervision
- `/coach_dashboard` - View coach dashboard with athlete activity

#### 3.2 Add Coach Menu Options
**File**: `src/easy_track/bot.py`

Extend main menu with coach options:
- "üë• My Athletes" - Manage athletes
- "üìä Athletes Progress" - View athlete measurements
- "üîî Coach Notifications" - Manage coach notifications

#### 3.3 Permission Middleware
**File**: `src/easy_track/bot.py`

```python
async def require_coach_permission(handler_func):
    """Decorator to require coach permissions."""

async def require_athlete_access(handler_func):
    """Decorator to require access to specific athlete."""
```

### **Step 4: Notification System Extensions**

#### 4.1 Coach Notification Types
**File**: `src/easy_track/models.py`

```python
class CoachNotificationType(str, Enum):
    ATHLETE_MEASUREMENT_ADDED = "athlete_measurement_added"
    ATHLETE_GOAL_ACHIEVED = "athlete_goal_achieved"
    ATHLETE_INACTIVE = "athlete_inactive"

class CoachNotificationPreference(Base):
    __tablename__ = "coach_notification_preferences"

    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    coach_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"), nullable=False)
    notification_type: Mapped[CoachNotificationType] = mapped_column(String(50), nullable=False)
    is_enabled: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(Boolean, default=True, nullable=False)
    created_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now())
```

#### 4.2 Notification Triggers
**File**: `src/easy_track/repositories.py`

```python
class CoachNotificationRepository:
    @staticmethod
    async def notify_coaches_of_measurement(session: AsyncSession, athlete_id: int, measurement: Measurement):
        """Notify coaches when athlete adds measurement."""

    @staticmethod
    async def get_coach_notification_preferences(session: AsyncSession, coach_id: int) -> List[CoachNotificationPreference]:
        """Get coach's notification preferences."""
```

### **Step 5: Integration Points**

#### 5.1 Update Measurement Creation
**File**: `src/easy_track/bot.py`

When athlete adds measurement:
1. Save measurement (existing logic)
2. Trigger coach notifications (new logic)

#### 5.2 Update User Registration
**File**: `src/easy_track/bot.py`

New users default to `UserRole.ATHLETE` role.

#### 5.3 Add Role Management
**File**: `src/easy_track/bot.py`

Command to promote user to coach: `/become_coach`

## üîß Technical Considerations

### **Database Constraints**
- Prevent self-coaching relationships
- Ensure unique coach-athlete pairs
- Cascade deletion handling

### **Permission System**
- Role-based access control
- Coach can only access their athletes' data
- Athletes can have multiple coaches

### **Notification Performance**
- Batch notifications for multiple coaches
- Rate limiting for notification frequency
- Asynchronous notification processing

### **Data Privacy**
- Coaches see only permitted athlete data
- Athletes can revoke coach access
- Audit trail for coach actions

## üöÄ Current Progress

**STATUS**: All Phases Complete! System Ready for Production ‚úÖ

**NEXT STEP**: Production deployment and monitoring

**CURRENT TASK**: System is fully functional and ready for use
